                            <p><b style="color:black">Jonathon Knauff</b> is an aspiring UX/UI Designer from Denver, CO. He takes inspiration from modern and futuristic technology while trying to keep his designs neat and minimalistic. His interest in design started well before he started with any UX/UI work as he was heavily invested in his music career, specializing in sound design. <br> <br>

                            Before his UX/UI design journey, he worked as a assistant manager, server and bartender for 10 years where he learned a lot of the communication skills he leverages today, It was a fantastic outlet for him to be social and meet a lot of cool people!<br> <br>
                                    
                            Outside of his professional life he enjoys quality time with family and his fat cat, Pepper. He loves getting immersed in new and retro video games, especially the kind that give him a real challenge. He loves staying up to date with news on the latest and greatest tech and tinkering with and fixing old and broken hardware. He thinks that one of the best feelings in life is bringing life back into something that someone threw away thinking it was broken.
